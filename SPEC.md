The Customer
------------
- The customer opens the app and starts an account with FB or email.  
- It then goes to default showing biz that are part of our program with the nearest ones showing up 1st.  
- The customer can search for the name of their favorite place 
- In the list of biz there's a default pic and the address plus a "save" button when they hit that it changes to "saved" the "Saved" button should be a different color and a popup that says " You will now be notified of perks from _______
- If they hit the "saved" button it goes back to "save"
- Any saved biz that has a perk running should show up in the feed
- When the customer get a perk it should have a redeem button - when they redeem it a new window shows with the pic of the perk the cost and say "show this when making your purchase' 
- If you redeem a perk 2 hours after the perk ends the perk goes away 

The Biz owner 
-------------
- The perks the biz sends out is time sensitive (one point of difference for us) 
- The perk can be done at any time by the biz themselves
- The biz will get 15 free perks then a fee kicks in
- In the biz backend it should say how many people claimed their perk
- When the biz 1st joins they need to input their info name, address, phone. profile pic etc.

The biz owner can login and start a perk - that perk can have a short detail and a longer details plus a pic - It will have box for how much that item normally cost and what the perk price is --- As an example the normal price would might be $10.00 and the perk price is $5.00 so we would automatically fill in the % discount of 50% 
also the date and time, the perk can only last from 2 hours to 12 hours and the push notification should go out one hour before the perk starts - our system will not allow them to do a 1 hour perk
