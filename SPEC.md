The Customer
------------
- The customer opens the app and starts an account with FB or email.  
- It then goes to default showing biz that are part of our program with the nearest ones showing up 1st.  
- The customer can search for the name of their favorite place 
- In the list of biz there's a default pic and the address plus a "save" button when they hit that it changes to "saved" the "Saved" button should be a different color and a popup that says " You will now be notified of perks from _______
- If they hit the "saved" button it goes back to "save"
- Any saved biz that has a perk running should show up in the feed
- When the customer get a perk it should have a redeem button - when they redeem it a new window shows with the pic of the perk the cost and say "show this when making your purchase' 
- If you redeem a perk 2 hours after the perk ends the perk goes away 

The Biz owner 
-------------
- The perks the biz sends out is time sensitive (one point of difference for us) 
- The perk can be done at any time by the biz themselves
- The biz will get 15 free perks then a fee kicks in
- In the biz backend it should say how many people claimed their perk
- When the biz 1st joins they need to input their info name, address, phone. profile pic etc.

The biz owner can login and start a perk - that perk can have a short detail and a longer details plus a pic - It will have box for how much that item normally cost and what the perk price is --- As an example the normal price would might be $10.00 and the perk price is $5.00 so we would automatically fill in the % discount of 50% 
also the date and time, the perk can only last from 2 hours to 12 hours and the push notification should go out one hour before the perk starts - our system will not allow them to do a 1 hour perk

The Biz Page
------------
The Biz page should have a cover photo and a short description with the address and phone number with 2 to 4 additional pics at the bottom - we can use Dean's Downtown as an example.

Happy Hour should be called "Insta Hour" On the Biz Page on the 2nd half should say "Start Insta Hour" Get 50% off all drinks $10 and under all day and night Sunday thru Thursday - Or it could be a button at the top of the biz page that says "Insta Hour" and when they clicked it would go to a page that has the detail of the insta hour with a big button that says "Start Insta Hour'.

Both the "Insta Hour" and the "Insta Perk" timer page needs to have "Invite Friends" button and when click does what the screen shot does - the invite friend should say - I'm at Dean's Downtown right now. Get here! (Then have the Google maps coordinates)
